# Draftform
Draftform is a 2D parametric modeling toolkit. It primarily operates on bezier curves and ellipses. I came up with the name by combining how creating these curves is "drafting" and also how it can be used to create a "form". There are several tools included that operate on a 2d canvas.
<ul>
  <li>Pen - draw connected cubic bezier curves very similar in other programs such as inkscape and photoshop</li>
  <li>Bezier - draw a single nth degree bezier curve</li>
  <li>Vertex - create helper points as guides and point snapping</li>
  <li>Arc - draw partial ellipses</li>
  <li>Polygon - create a polygon with n sides</li>
  <li>Select - select points and drag them around</li>
  <li>Rotate - rotate points that have been previously selected</li>
</ul>
Some of the tools are a little rough righ now including the Arc tool and Select tool. Using a combination of these tools one can draw nearly any shape in a vector format.

I made this because I couldn't find any raw 2d modeling toolkit. In my game that I am creating, The player needs to be able to draw shapes in order to create levels. I hope this can help others needing a 2d modeler.
